Though not the tallest building in Kenya, it dominates the skyline with a 28-story tower overlooking a large amphitheater. Its pale terra-cotta fa√ßade recalls the color of traditional African huts, and the central plenary hall resembles the ancient Roman Senate.Zoom up to the rooftop viewing platform to take photos of the sprawling city below, and you can also enjoy a meal at one of the restaurants.Address: Harambee Avenue, Nairobi",

Half-timbered houses and flowering gardens remain, but seem more suited to southern England than Africa.Several walking trails traverse the hills, offering beautiful views of the valleys below. Wildlife is also visible in the area. Buffalo, gazelles, giraffes, bushbuck, the occasional klipspringer, and troupes of baboons are often glimpsed grazing along the roadside.Address: Great Rift Valley, Mageso Chember, Nairobi",
